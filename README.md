# Renaming

Consists of main.py and renameFiles.py where function definition is.

There are 3 types of "copy_and_rename_files" I used with different naming conventions during the Project Ovosad. Espesially position of tree is tricky and may need updating according to what files name will be. 

Actual branch to use is "final" (TODO merge to master).
